# SortArrayList

Sort ArrayList) Write the following method that sorts an ArrayList:
public static <E extends Comparable<E>>
  void sort(ArrayList<E> list)
  Basically the assignment wants to me again like the last assignment create a method that instead of shuffling
  it sorts the contents in whatever way you want to to be sorted, so like lets say you want it be ascending then
  you can put some numbers and have the numbers go from 0-10 or descending and have it go from 10-0.

## Example Output

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

```
Give examples
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
